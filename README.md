<h1> SELECT </h1>


<p>
    
<b>'SELECT'</b> statement is used to select, filter and transform specific data from collections using LINQ in C#. A new table (or in general, a new data set) can be created from a collection with a SELECT statement.
</p>

<h2> Anonym Type  </h2>

<p>
    Anonymous types are types that do not have a named type, typically used for LINQ queries or fast temporary data migrations.

<h2> View Model(VM) Type  </h2>

<p>
    While anonymous types are generally short-lived and used for a specific query or operation, ViewModels are classes that are generally longer-lived and designed to be used in a specific user interface (UI) part.
